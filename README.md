## Installation

####  Our work is based on Python 3.7 and Pytorch 1.7.1+cu111 due to the  [CLIP requirement](https://github.com/openai/CLIP). The hardware is Nvidia Tesla V100 single GPU. Give a big thanks to Dr. Li WuYang with his work [SIGMA](https://github.com/CityU-AIM-Group/SIGMA). We use it as baseline. The trained pth are  uploaded to [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pMiPDe1If7rssy6332jL6lu_MAzy8UXo?usp=drive_link).
